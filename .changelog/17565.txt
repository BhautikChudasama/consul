```release-note:feature
reloadable config: Made enable_debug config reloadable and enable pprof command to work when config toggles to true
```

```release-note:breaking-change
reloadable config: the GET call to /debug/pprof/profile -> will not return 400 now [returns 200], because earlier the handlers were added after checking enable_debug flag and checking ACLDisabled status.
Now the handlers are attached anyhow, and these checks are added inside the handlers so that the same logic persists. This will enable the able when flag is toggled.
```
