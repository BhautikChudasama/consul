# Exported Services HTTP Endpoint

-> **1.17.3+:** The exported services API is available in Consul versions 1.17.3 and newer.

The `/exported-services` endpoint returns the list of exported services and their consumers.

This will fetch all of the services that were exported using an
[`exported-services` configuration entry](/consul/docs/connect/config-entries/exported-services).
Sameness groups and wildcards in the configuration entry are expanded in the response.

## List Exported Services

If overrides are needed they are passed as the JSON-encoded request body and
the `POST` method must be used, otherwise `GET` is sufficient.

| Method             | Path                 | Produces           |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`              | `/exported-services` | `application/json` |


The table below shows this endpoint's support for
[blocking queries](/consul/api-docs/features/blocking),
[consistency modes](/consul/api-docs/features/consistency),
[agent caching](/consul/api-docs/features/caching), and
[required ACLs](/consul/api-docs/api-structure#authentication).

| Blocking Queries | Consistency Modes | Agent Caching   | ACL Required                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `YES`            | `none`            | `none`          | `mesh:read` or `operator:read` |


### Query Parameters

- `partition` `(string: "")` <EnterpriseAlert inline /> - Specifies the partition from which the
