# Automate ZScaler Private Access application segments with CTS

This topic describes how to automatically configure your ZScaler Private Access (ZPA) application segments using Terraform and Consul.

## Overview

You can use Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) for network infrastructure automation (NIA). This enables you to automatically update your infrastructure and network devices using Terraform whenever your service networking control plane (Consul) changes.

The following image shows the basic architecture of an NIA setup with ZPA application segment.

Complete the following steps to configure your ZPA application segment:

1. Register your Consul services
1. Configure CTS
1. Start CTS
1. Verify NIA workflow

## Background

CTS is an automation tool that uses Consul's service catalog as a source of truth for all applications running in a given environment. When it detects changes to the services (for example, a new service node is added or deleted from the service list), CTS dynamically applies the necessary changes to your infrastructure using Terraform, in this case, the ZPA application segment resources.

ZPA [application segments](https://help.zscaler.com/zpa/about-applications) are groups of applications that often share access type or user privileges. You can use ZPA application segments to reduce your application's attack surface by limiting access to extraneous ports and specific users.

The [`application-segment-nia`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/zscaler/application-segment-nia/zpa/latest) Terraform module, a ZScaler-managed Terraform module for CTS, lets operators automate their network infrastructure by dynamically configuring domain entries in your application segments based on changes to the respective services in Consul.

The following diagram shows an example network infrastructure automation (NIA) workflow with Terraform, Consul, CTS, and ZPA.

1. Consul catalog updates with new service registrations or changes
1. CTS subscribes to updates from Consul catalog
1. When CTS detects changes from Consul catalog, it initiates run with the specified module to apply the changes

<Tip>

ZScaler also manages the [`application-server-nia`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/zscaler/application-server-nia/zpa/latest) Terraform NIA module. This module will create and update application servers in ZPA when CTS detects changes in Consul services.

</Tip>

This topic assumes you are familiar with the standard Consul workflow and CTS. If you are unfamiliar with these topics, reference their respective tutorials to learn more.

- Complete the [Get Started with Consul on VMs](/consul/tutorials/get-started-vms) or [Get Started with Consul on Kubernetes](/consul/tutorials/get-started-kubernetes) tutorials to learn more about Consul.
- Complete the [Network Infrastructure Automation with Consul-Terraform-Sync Intro](/consul/tutorials/network-infrastructure-automation/consul-terraform-sync-intro) tutorial to learn more about CTS.

## Requirements

1. A Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) Tenant
1. ZPA API Credentials. You will use these credentials to authenticate both Terraform and CTS to create and manage resources in ZPA Cloud.
1. A Consul datacenter for service networking
1. A server with [Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) installed. This server must be able to communicate with the ZPA and the Consul datacenter.
~> **Compatibility Note:** CTS requires Terraform 0.13 or later. You can either install Terraform before starting CTS or let the CTS install a compatible Terraform version for you.
1. Application servers running a service. You must register these servers to Consul. Refer to [Register Services with Service Definitions](/consul/docs/discover/services) for instructions.
1. A running instance of the ZPA App Connector. 

## Configure ZPA application segment

The following example Terraform configuration shows a minimum service load balancing (SLB) configuration required for the ZPA application segment and NIA integration. When your Consul services change, CTS will automatically modify the ZPA application segment's domain entries.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="main.tf">

```hcl
provider "zpa" {}

resource "zpa_segment_group" "segment_group" {
  name            = "${var.aws_region}-${module.network.vpc_id}"
  description     = "${var.aws_region}-${module.network.vpc_id}"
  enabled         = true
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Register your Consul services

Before you can use CTS, you must register your services to Consul.

1. For each service, create a service configuration file with information about the service (for example, IP, port, etc), and health check information. Refer to the [service registration usage docs](/consul/docs/discovery/services) to learn how to register Consul services.

  <Tabs>
  <Tab heading="HCL" group="hcl">

  Create a service configuration file with the following details named `web.hcl`.

  <CodeBlockConfig filename="web.hcl">

  ```hcl
  service {
    name = "web"
    id = "web"
    tags = ["web"]
    port = 80
    check {
      id = "web"
      name = "web TCP check"
      tcp = "localhost:80"
      interval = "15s"
      timeout = "1s"
    }
  }
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

  </Tab>
  <Tab heading="JSON" group="json">

  Create a service configuration file with the following details named `web.json`.

  <CodeBlockConfig filename="web.json">

  ```json
  {
  "service": {
    "name": "web",
    "id": "web",
    "tags": ["web"],
    "port": 80,
    "check": {
      "id": "web",
      "name": "web TCP check",
      "http": "localhost:80",
      "interval": "15s",
      "timeout": "1s"
    }
    }
  }
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

  </Tab>
  </Tabs>

1. Once you have created the configuration file, register the service with Consul.

  <Tabs>
  <Tab heading="HCL" group="hcl">

  ```shell-session
  $ consul services register web.hcl
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab heading="JSON" group="json">

  ```shell-session
  $ consul services register web.json
  ```

  </Tab>
  </Tabs>

## Configure CTS

CTS requires access to the Consul catalog. If you're using Consul as a Terraform backend, you will also need privileges to store the Terraform state into Consul's key-value (KV) store.

In production environments, we recommend enabling access control lists (ACLs) on Consul. With ACLs enabled, CTS must pass a token in its configuration to retrieve information from Consul. Refer to the [production CTS tutorial](/consul/tutorials/network-infrastructure-automation/consul-terraform-sync-secure) for more information about ACL tokens and an example of a secure CTS configuration.

Create a CTS configuration file that defines a set of tasks to run when a service is registered or removed from Consul.  In the following example, CTS uses the `consul` and `zpa` providers to run the `slb_auto_config` task when the `web80` service changes.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="tasks.hcl">

```hcl
log_level = "info"

driver "terraform" {
  log = true
  required_providers {
    zpa = {
      source = "zscaler/zpa"
      version = "2.7.9"
    }
  }
}

# Consul Config Options
consul {
  address = "${consul}:8500"
}

terraform_provider "zpa" {
  zpa_client_id       = "{{ env \"ZPA_CLIENT_ID\" }}"
  zpa_client_secret   = "{{ env \"ZPA_CLIENT_SECRET\" }}"
  zpa_customer_id     = "{{ env \"ZPA_CUSTOMER_ID\" }}"
}

task {
  name = "zpa_application_segment"
  description = "This task dynamically updates application segments domain names, tcp ports"
  providers = ["zpa"]
  module = "zscaler/application-segment-nia/zpa"
  condition "services" {
    names = ["web"]
  }
  variable_files = [""]
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The `driver` block defines all Terraform providers required to execute the task. In the following example, the `zscaler/zpa` provider is required.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="tasks.hcl" hideClipboard highlight="5">

```hcl
driver "terraform" {
  log = true
  required_providers {
    zpa = {
      source = "zscaler/zpa"
      version = "2.7.9"
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The `terraform_provider` specifies the parameters to interact with the ZPA.

<Note title="Security Note">

   In a production environment, we recommend separating any sensitive credentials from the CTS configuration files and loading them dynamically using environment variables, Consul KV, or HashiCorp Vault. Refer to the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/zscaler/zpa/latest/docs#authentication) for a full set of provider arguments.

</Note>

<CodeBlockConfig filename="tasks.hcl" hideClipboard>

```hcl
terraform_provider "zpa" {
  zpa_client_id       = "{{ env \"ZPA_CLIENT_ID\" }}"
  zpa_client_secret   = "{{ env \"ZPA_CLIENT_SECRET\" }}"
  zpa_customer_id     = "{{ env \"ZPA_CUSTOMER_ID\" }}"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The `task` block defines a task for CTS to run when specific Consul services change.

- `name` defines the task name.
- `providers` defines the providers this task uses. In this case, the previously defined `zpa` provider.
- `module` defines the path to the ZPA Terraform NIA module. CTS automatically applies this module whenever it detects changes to the specified Consul service to dynamically create and update ZPA application segments to reflect the service's new status.
- `condition "services"` defines the Consul services that, when changed, would trigger this CTS task. The names must match the name of the Consul service you want to trigger the task (in this case, `web`).

<CodeBlockConfig filename="tasks.hcl" hideClipboard>

```hcl
task {
  name = "zpa_application_segment"
  description = "This task dynamically updates application segments domain names, tcp ports"
  providers = ["zpa"]
  module = "zscaler/application-segment-nia/zpa"
  condition "services" {
    names = ["web"]
  }
  variable_files = [""]
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

For more details about the configuration, refer to the [CTS configuration docs](/consul/docs/nia/configuration). For more details on the Terraform NIA module for ZPA application segments, refer to the [Terraform Registry documentation ](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/zscaler/application-segment-nia/zpa/latest) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zscaler/terraform-zpa-application-segment-nia).

## Start CTS

Run the `consul-terraform-sync start` command to start CTS. This command performs the following operations:

- download and install the Terraform providers and modules according to the configuration file you have provided (`tasks.hcl`),
- create Terraform files for the defined tasks, and 
- connect to Consul.

```shell-session
$ consul-terraform-sync start -config-file=tasks.hcl

[INFO] (ctrl) task completed zpa_application_segment
[INFO] (ctrl) all tasks completed once

```

CTS continuously runs as a daemon and automatically executes the `zpa_application_segment` task when it detects changes to the `web` Consul service.

## Verify NIA automation workflow

Verify the workflow by registering new instances of the `web` service in Consul.

Create a service configuration file with the following details named `web2.hcl`. The only difference between this configuration and `web.hcl` is the service ID is set to `web2`.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="web2.hcl">

```hcl
service {
  name = "web"
  id = "web2"
  tags = ["web"]
  port = 80
  check {
    id = "web"
    name = "web TCP check"
    tcp = "localhost:80"
    interval = "15s"
    timeout = "1s"
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Then, register the service with Consul.

```shell-session
$ consul services register web2.hcl
```

Once CTS detects the new Consul service, it will automatically trigger the `zpa_application_segment` task, as defined in the configuration file. The task uses Terraform to update the ZPA application segment domain entries to include the new Consul service instances. Instead, if you de-registered the Consul service, CTS will update the ZPA application segment domain entries to remove the servers. 

The CTS task updates the application segment to include the new instances.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```log

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.zpa_application_segment.zpa_application_segment.this["web"] will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "zpa_application_segment" "this" {
      ~ domain_names                  = [
          + "ip-10-0-200-212.us-west-2.compute.internal",
          + "ip-10-0-200-62.us-west-2.compute.internal",
        ]
        id                            = "216196257331327661"
        name                          = "web"
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
module.zpa_application_segment.zpa_application_segment.this["web"]: Modifying... [id=216196257331327661]
module.zpa_application_segment.zpa_application_segment.this["web"]: Modifications complete after 2s [id=216196257331327661]

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.
[INFO]  ctrl: task completed: task_name=zpa_application_segment
[INFO]  ctrl: all tasks completed once
[INFO]  ctrl: start task monitoring
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Once the task completes, connect to Zscaler using the [Zscaler Client Connector Agent](https://help.zscaler.com/z-app/what-zscaler-app). Confirm that your ZPA application segment now shows two domain entries, one for each instance of the `web` service.

CTS will trigger the task every time you add or remove  a service with the same name to Consul. With CTS and network infrastructure automation, the ZPA application segment configurations will automatically reflect these changes in near-real time.
