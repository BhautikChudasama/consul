# Link east/west network segments

This topic provides an overview of the strategies and processes for linking defined segments of your service mesh to extend east/west operations across cloud regions, runtimes, and platforms. Linking network segments into an extended service mesh enables advanced strategies for deploying and monitoring service operations in your network.

For more information about how to divide your network, including the difference between deployment strategies enabled by methods such as WAN federation and cluster peering, refer to [segment network](/consul/docs/segment).

## Introduction

Consul supports two general strategies for extending east/west service mesh traffic across your network:

1. Cluster peering
1. Wide Area Network (WAN) federation

Each strategy for extending your network has a distinct workflow to establish and verify traffic across datacenters in your service mesh.

Consul community edition supports basic cluster peering and federation scenarios. Implementing advanced scenarios such as federated network areas and cluster peering between multiple admin partitions in datacenters require Consul Enterprise. Refer to [Consul Enterprise](consul/docs/enterprise) for more information.

## Cluster peering

Cluster peering lets you connect two or more independent Consul clusters so that services deployed to different partitions or datacenters can communicate. Add a sentence or two about how cluster peering works.

Refer to the [Cluster peering documentation](/consul/docs/link/cluster-peering#guidance) for more information.

## WAN federation

In Consul, federation is the act of joining two or more Consul datacenters. When datacenters are joined, Consul servers in each datacenter can communicate with one another. This enables the following features:

1. Services on all clusters can make calls to each other through Consul Service Mesh.
1. Intentions can be used to enforce rules about which services can communicate across all clusters.
1. L7 Routing Rules can enable multi-cluster failover and traffic splitting.
1. The Consul UI has a drop-down menu that lets you navigate between datacenters.

Refer to the [WAN federation documentation](/consul/docs/link/wan-federation#guidance) for more information.

## Federated network areas

Network areas specify a relationship between a pair of Consul datacenters. Operators create reciprocal areas on each side of the relationship and then join them together, so a given Consul datacenter can participate in many areas, even when some of the peer areas cannot contact each other. This allows for more flexible relationships between Consul datacenters, such as hub/spoke or more general tree structures. Traffic between areas is all performed via server RPC (8300/tcp) so it can be secured with just TLS.

Refer to the [Network area documentation](/consul/docs/link/network-area) for more information.

## Secure communication with mesh gateways

Mesh gateways enable service mesh traffic to be routed between different Consul datacenters. Datacenters can reside in different clouds or runtime environments where general interconnectivity between all services in all datacenters isn't feasible. In production environments, we recommend deploying mesh gateways to further secure communication between datacenters deployed to different cloud regions or platforms.

Refer to the [Mesh gateway documentation](/consul/docs/link/mesh-gateway) for more information.

## Guidance

The following resources are available to help you extend your service mesh in an east/west direction by linking segments of your network.

### Runtime-specific usage documentation

For runtime specific guidance, including federating clusters across runtimes, refer to the following topics:

- [Extend network east/west on virtual machines](/consul/docs/link/vm#guidance)
- [Extend network east/west on Kubernetes](/consul/docs/link/k8s#guidance)
- [WAN federation between virtual machines and Kubernetes clusters](/consul/docs/link/wan-federation/k8s-vm)

### Reference documentation

For reference material related to the processes for extending your service mesh by linking segments of your network, refer to the following pages:

- [CLI reference: `consul join` command](/consul/commands/join)
- [CLI reference: `consul operator area` command](/consul/commands/operator/area)
- [CLI reference: `peering` command](/consul/commands/peering)
- [Mesh gateway configuration reference](/consul/docs/reference/proxy/connect-proxy)
- [Proxy defaults configuration reference](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/proxy-defaults)

### Constraints, limitations, and troubleshooting

If you experience errors when linking segments of your network, refer to the following list of technical constraints.

- Consul does not support deployments that use WAN federation and cluster peering simultaneously.
- The Consul UI does not support the creation of cluster peering connections, WAN-federated datacenters, federated network areas, or mesh gateways. A dedicated user interface to view, create, and manage cluster peering connections is available through [HCP Consul Central](/hcp/docs/consul/monitor/consul-central/network-views#cluster-peering).
