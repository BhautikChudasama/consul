# Global settings for Configure Consul-Terraform-Sync

This topic describes how to define global settings in the Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) configuration file.

## Overview

CTS generates suitable default values for many global settings, but we recommend configuring TLS settings for the CTS API, working directory, and default buffer period for dynamic tasks. Refer to [Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) configuration reference](/consul/docs/reference/cts) for details about all configuration parameters.

## Define the working directory

CTS generates local artifacts to prepare configuration versions used for workspace runs. You can set the default location of the files created with the [`working_dir`](/consul/docs/reference/cts#working_dir) option. You can also configure the working directory for each task. When a task is configured with a local module and is run with the Terraform Cloud driver, the local module is copied and uploaded as a part of the configuration version.

## Define CTS API settings

Configure the following settings so that the CTS API is able to securely perform its operations:

1. Specify a port number to serve CTS API requests. If unspecified, CTS uses port number `8558`. Refer to [`port`](/consul/docs/reference/cts#port) in the configuration reference for additional information.
1. Specify TLS configurations, such as the location of the PEM-encoded certificate files. Refer to [`tls`](/consul/docs/reference/cts#tls) in the configuration reference for additional information.

## Define buffer period

You can specify additional time that CTS should wait after it detects changes before triggering dynamic tasks. The buffer period is intended to reduce _flapping_, which refers to when a component changes state too frequently resulting in  errors. Refer to [`buffer_period`](/consul/docs/reference/cts#buffer_period) in the configuration reference for additional information.
