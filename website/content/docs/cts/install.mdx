# Install Consul-Terraform-Sync

This topic describes how to install Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS). The CTS daemon runs alongside Consul that you must install separately. Refer to [Network infrastructure automation](/consul/docs/cts) for information about CTS.

> Complete the [Automate your network configuration with Consul-Terraform-Sync tutorial](/consul/tutorials/network-infrastructure-automation/consul-terraform-sync-intro?utm_source=docs) for hands-on installation and configuration guidance. 

Use one of the following methods to install CTS:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Pre-compiled binary">

1. Download the appropriate package for your environment as a zip archive from the [HashiCorp releases website](https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-terraform-sync/). For the CTS Enterprise binary, download a zip archive with the `+ent` metadata. CTS Enterprise requires a Consul Enterprise license. Refer to [Consul-Terraform-Sync Enterprise License](/consul/docs/cts/enterprise/license) for additional information.
1. Unzip the package to extract the binary named `consul-terraform-sync`. 
1. Move the `consul-terraform-sync` binary to a location available on your `PATH`, for example:

  ```shell-session
  $ echo $PATH
  /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
  $ mv ./consul-terraform-sync /usr/local/bin/consul-terraform-sync
  ```

1. Run the `consul-terraform-sync -version` command to verify the installation. The version for the CTS Enterprise binary includes the `+ent` metadata.

<Tab heading="Docker">

You can install and run CTS as a Docker container. Refer to the [documentation on Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync) for instructions. 

For the CTS Enterprise, use the [`hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync-enterprise`](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync-enterprise) Docker image.

```shell-session
$ docker pull hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync
```

Run the `consul-terraform-sync -version` command to verify the installation. The version for the CTS Enterprise binary includes the `+ent` metadata.

```shell-session
$ docker run --rm hashicorp/consul-terraform-sync -version
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Homebrew on OS X">

The CTS OSS binary is available in the HashiCorp tap, which is a repository of all our Homebrew packages.

```shell-session
$ brew tap hashicorp/tap
$ brew install hashicorp/tap/consul-terraform-sync
```

Run the following command to update to the latest version:

```shell-session
$ brew upgrade hashicorp/tap/consul-terraform-sync
```

Run the `consul-terraform-sync -version` command to verify the installation. The version for the CTS Enterprise binary includes the `+ent` metadata.
