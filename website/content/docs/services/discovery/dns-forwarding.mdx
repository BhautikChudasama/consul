# DNS Forwarding

The first block is the description. It explains what the topic is about. If the page description and the topic introduction are short, you can merge the information into a single description block, but we recommend using separate blocks to help you draft the content. 

> **Tutorial**: Learn how to perform this task in a [tutorial](link). 

## Background

By default, DNS is served from port 53. On most operating systems, this requires elevated privileges. Rather than running Consul with an administrative or root account, you can forward appropriate queries to Consul (running on an unprivileged port) from another DNS server or port redirect.

## Requirements

To complete this tutorial, you will need a running Consul agent. Consul should be running with default settings and serving DNS on port 8600.

By default, Consul does not resolve DNS records outside the .consul. zone unless the recursors configuration option has been set. For example, if a Consul DNS reply includes a CNAME record pointing outside the .consul top level domain (TLD), then the DNS reply will only include CNAME records by default. When recursors is set and the upstream resolver is functioning correctly, however, Consul will try to resolve CNAMEs and include any records (e.g., A, AAAA, PTR) for them in its DNS reply. 

The requirements block describes the following information necessary to operate the product as described in the topic:

- system
- environment
- software requirements
- product version: Note that because we have versioned docs, specifying the core product version is not as important as version requirements for ancillary software, such as `kubectl`.

### Sub requirement 

The requirements section may include the following information:

- prerequisites
- constraints
- any other conditions or operating parameters

## Multi-step procedure

Depending on the context, you can either add an introduction statement about the procedure or begin describing the procedure directly.

1. If the procedure describes a series of commands, we recommend setting environment variables as the first step so that you can use the variable name in subsequent commands. In some cases, you can place the response or output into the same code block. Always link to the relevant [reference documentation](link):

   <COMMAND>
   <RESPONSE>

   Provide any additional context about the step as either a new paragraph in the step or as a list nested within the step.

1. The next step may require the user to configure a file. Always link to the relevant [reference documentation](link). Use appropriate code blocks as necessary:

   <CodeBlock>

   ```lang
   Some.code = value
   ```

   </CodeBlock>

1. The final step may require another command. Always link to the relevant [reference documentation](link):

   <COMMAND>

   If the response or outcome requires additional explanation, describe it as part of the step:

   <RESPONSE>

### Single-step procedure   

The single-step procedure (SSP) block describes a procedure or group of procedures that result in a specific outcome. Use SSP blocks when step-by-step instructions are not feasible.
