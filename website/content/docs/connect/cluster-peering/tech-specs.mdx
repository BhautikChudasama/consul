# Cluster peering best practices

This reference topic describes recommendations and best practices when using cluster peering in your Consul deployments. To learn more about Consul's cluster peering feature, refer to [cluster peering overview](/consul/docs/connect/cluster-peering).

## Requirements

Consul's default configuration supports cluster peering connections directly between clusters. In production environments, we recommend using mesh gateways to securely route service mesh traffic between partitions with cluster peering connections.

In addition, make sure your Consul environment meets the following prerequisites:

- Consul v1.14 or higher.
- A local Consul agent is required to manage mesh gateway configurations.

## Best practices

We suggest the following best practices:

- When you generate peering tokens, use the following naming convention so that your configurations are human readable: `<remote-dc-name>.<remote-partition-name>`. For example, the instructions to [create a cluster peering connection](/consul/docs/connect/cluster-peering/usage) begin by generating a peering token for `dc1` that assigns the name `dc2-default` to the peer cluster. As a result, configuration entries that manage traffic with the peer cluster use `Peer: "dc2-default"` to configure traffic.

## Mesh gateway recommendations

When cluster peering through mesh gateways, consider the following deployment recommendaitons:

- Register a mesh gateway as a Consul service in order to export services to peers in other regions or cloud providers.
- Register the mesh gateway in the same Consul admin partition as the exported services and their `exported-services` configuration entry. An Enterprise license is required to use multiple admin partitions with a single cluster of Consul servers.
- Define the `Proxy.Config` block in the mesh gateway configuration using opaque parameters compatible with your proxy. Refer to the [Gateway options](/consul/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#gateway-options) and [Escape-hatch Overrides](/consul/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#escape-hatch-overrides) documentation for additional Envoy proxy configuration information.

### Mesh gateway modes

By default, cluster peering connections use mesh gateways in [remote mode](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/mesh-gateway/service-to-service-traffic-wan-datacenters#remote). The `none` mode is invalid for mesh gateways with cluster peering connections.

Depending on your network's requirements, consider the following recommendations for setting a datacenter's mesh gateway mode:

- For mesh gateways that connect peered clusters, set the `mode` as either `remote` or `local`.
- To use the `local` mesh gateway mode, you must register a mesh gateway in the importing cluster.

Refer to [mesh gateway modes](/consul/docs/connect/gateways/mesh-gateway#modes) for more information.

## Sidecar proxy recommendations

You must configure the Envoy proxies that function as sidecars in your service mesh in order to properly route traffic to peers. Sidecar proxies are defined in the [service definition](/consul/docs/services/usage/define-services).

- Configure the `proxy.upstreams` parameters to route traffic to the correct service, namespace, and peer. Refer to the [`upstreams`](/consul/docs/connect/proxies/proxy-config-reference#upstream-configuration-reference) documentation for details.
- The `proxy.upstreams.destination_name` parameter is always required.
- The `proxy.upstreams.destination_peer` parameter must be configured to enable cross-cluster traffic.
- The `proxy.upstream.destination_namespace` configuration is only necessary if the destination service is in a non-default namespace.

## ACL recommendations

When ACLs are enabled, add tokens to grant the following permissions:

- Grant `service:write` permissions to services that define mesh gateways in their server definition.
- Grant `service:read` permissions for all services on the partition.
- Grant `mesh:write` permissions to the mesh gateways that participate in cluster peering connections. This permission allows a leaf certificate to be issued for mesh gateways to terminate TLS sessions for HTTP requests.
