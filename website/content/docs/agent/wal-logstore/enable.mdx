# Enable the WAL LogStore backend

WAL LogStore is now enabled by default unless a BoltDB database already exist.
See [migrate to WAL with an existing boltDB database](/consul/docs/agent/wal-logstore/migrate-to-wal)
for more details on how to migrate to WAL when you already have a boltDB database.

## Known issues

The following issues exist in Consul 1.15.0 and 1.15.1.

 * A follower that is disconnected may be unable to catch up if it is using the WAL backend.
 * Restoring user snapshots can break replication to WAL-enabled followers.
 * Restoring user snapshots can cause a WAL-enabled leader to panic.
