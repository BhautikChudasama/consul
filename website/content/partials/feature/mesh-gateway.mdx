Mesh gateways enable service mesh traffic to be routed between different Consul datacenters. Datacenters can reside in different clouds or runtime environments where general interconnectivity between all services in all datacenters isn't feasible. In production environments, we recommend deploying mesh gateways to further secure communication between datacenters deployed to different cloud regions or platforms.

Refer to the [Mesh gateway documentation](/consul/docs/link/mesh-gateway) for more information.
