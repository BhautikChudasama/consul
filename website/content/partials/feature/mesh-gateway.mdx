Mesh gateways route service mesh traffic between different Consul datacenters. Datacenters can reside in different clouds or runtime environments where general interconnectivity between all services in all datacenters is not feasible. In hybrid or multi-cloud production environments, mesh gateways secure communication between datacenters deployed to different cloud regions or platforms.

Refer to the [Mesh gateway documentation](/consul/docs/link/mesh-gateway) for more information.
