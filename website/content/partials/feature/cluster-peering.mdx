Cluster peering connects two or more independent Consul clusters so that services deployed to different datacenters can communicate. The process to establish a cluster connection generates and exchanges peering tokens between admin partitions in each datacenter. HCP Consul enables additional support for cluster peering lifecycle operations through [HCP Consul Central](/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/consul-central).

You can interact with Consul's cluster peering feature using the CLI, the HTTP API, or the UI. Refer to the [Cluster peering documentation](/consul/docs/link/cluster-peering#guidance) for more information.
