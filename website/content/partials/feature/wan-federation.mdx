In Consul, federation is the act of joining two or more Consul datacenters. When datacenters are joined, Consul servers in each datacenter can communicate with one another. This enables the following features:

1. Services on all clusters can make calls to each other through Consul Service Mesh.
1. Intentions can be used to enforce rules about which services can communicate across all clusters.
1. L7 Routing Rules can enable multi-cluster failover and traffic splitting.
1. The Consul UI has a drop-down menu that lets you navigate between datacenters.

Refer to the [WAN federation documentation](/consul/docs/link/wan-federation#guidance) for more information.
