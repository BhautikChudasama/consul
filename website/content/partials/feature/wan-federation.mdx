In Consul, Wide Area Network (WAN) federation joins two or more Consul datacenters. These datacenters communicate using WAN gossip to function as if they were a single datacenter. WAN federation enables the following multi-cluster service mesh scenarios:

1. Services on all clusters can make calls to each other through Consul's service mesh.
1. Intentions can enforce rules about service communication across all clusters.
1. L7 routing that defines behavior for multi-cluster failover and traffic splitting.

Refer to the [WAN federation documentation](/consul/docs/link/wan-federation#guidance) for more information.
